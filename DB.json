                "review_txt": "Ten years ago, with much fanfare, the DC Extended Universe was born. Warner Brothers, riding the wave of success from Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, decided that rather than stick with stand-alone titles featuring their best-loved superheroes, they would instead chase Marvel by building a \"shared universe.\" The resultant umbrella project was rushed and chaotic with few standout films and a lot of duds. Justice League, rather than being DC's answer to The Avengers, was a colossal misstep from which the DCEU never recovered. Now, with James Gunn preparing to reboot the entire DC canon, the task has fallen to Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom - never during production intended to be a final chapter - to close the book on the DCEU. Perhaps fittingly, this anticlimactic slog is what we have come to expect from DC movies - an overlong, visually cluttered experience that's more interested in special effects and audio engineering than storytelling. The Aquaman sequel feels like it was mostly constructed in post-production, with CGI working hand-in-hand with editing to fashion something borderline-coherent. No matter how much fan love there might be for Jason Momoa, it's not enough to save this production.\n\nThere are essentially three major threads fighting for screen time. The first, and most enjoyable, relates to the brotherly rivalry between Arthur Curry (Momoa), King of Atlantis, and his deposed younger sibling, former King Orm (Patrick Wilson). Circumstances force Arthur to break Orm out of prison and the two engage in a white-hot love/hate relationship worthy of a rom-com. (Momoa has about 10x more chemistry with Wilson than with Arthur's alleged love interest, Mera, played by either Amber Heard or her cardboard lookalike.) Then there's a revenge subplot, with Aquaman baddie Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) determined to wipe out Arthur's entire bloodline using the black magic powers of his newly acquired \"Black Trident.\" Finally, there's the weaponization of Climate Change - a plot contortion that recalls Superman IV's disastrous attempt to meld real-world geopolitical concerns with a comic book storyline.\n\nThe film's overcluttered CGI at least gives viewers pretty things to look at for two hours. Rupert Gregson-Williams' score sounds suitably epic with discordant beats preparing viewers for big battles and ugly confrontations. But none of this means much of anything considering how little tension even the most extreme confrontation generates. The movie is so predictable that it's possible to take a bathroom break in the middle of a major fight scene and have a more exciting time trying to get the automated soap dispenser working properly. I stepped out for two minutes and missed absolutely nothing. This is short attention span cinema at its most extreme.\n\nFollowing the success of Aquaman, Warner Brothers decided that the best approach was to reform the band. So, in addition to re-signing most of the actors, director James Wan was lured back. Rumor has it that early test screenings were disastrous. Amber Heard's involvement became divisive after her spousal abuse trial against Johnny Depp. The unclear future of the DCEU, which apparently resulted in both Michael Keaton and Ben Affleck filming scenes as Bruce Wayne (neither of which was ultimately used), hung like the Sword of Damocles over the extensive reshoots. Like The Flash, the movie was deemed too expensive a property to jettison, so it was released into theaters with a wing and a prayer - not the best strategy for a nine-figure production.\n\nTo the extent that there's anything worthwhile to be found in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom beyond the pretty visuals, one need look no further than the lead actor. Momoa has an easy, unforced charisma that shines regardless of whether he's re-enacting a scene from Three Men and a Baby, fighting to stay awake during an Atlantean council meeting, or trying to keep us from dozing off as he goes on an endless search for Black Manta.\n\nAs far as the Climate Change element is concerned - this aspect of the plot is so badly mishandled that it will thrill deniers far and wide. Climate Change is placed on the same level of fantastical nonsense as Black Magic Tridents and wondrous underwater cities. I'm sure that screenwriters had the best of intentions when writing this into the story but the same can be said of Lawrence Konner & Mark Rosenthal when they sat down at a typewriter in 1986. What did we get out of that? Nuclear Man.\n\nSo I raise my glass to the DCEU - a decade-long cinematic excursion that, done differently, might have left behind more than a few, widely-scattered good memories. Some want to blame the pandemic for its failure but this is more a case of deep structural instability exacerbated by egomaniacal personalities and inept planning. The first Aquaman may have been low-brow fun but the second is a chore from start to finish. Momoa, we are told, will be back with DC in a different role. Hopefully this time he'll have a screenplay worthy of his larger-than-life personality.\n\n© 2023 James Berardinelli",

                "review_txt": "Even though it is rather obviously trading on a familiar and beloved brand, Wonka is nevertheless a fun and imaginative family film - certainly better than one might expect from a production crassly viewed by some as a \"cash grab.\" While the movie is set up as a prequel to the 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, it owes as much to The Greatest Showman as it does to the earlier movie. The narrative manages the difficult task of resurrecting the blended sweetness and nastiness of the original confection. Although the story is original and Roald Dahl is credited only as the creator of the characters, the tone is reflective of his work. While Tim Burton leaned heavily into the dark weirdness of Dahl and Mel Stuart preferred to lighten the mood, Paul King skates a line in between the two.\n\n2023 hasn't been an especially good year for family entertainment. Most releases have either been too childish for adults to enjoy or too \"mature\" for younger kids to appreciate. Wonka is one of the few (and perhaps the only live action example) to find a happy medium. It's softer than the PG-13 Barbie and not as juvenile as the various cartoon movies that have dotted the landscape. Altogether, although far from a perfect motion picture, Wonka is better than one might expect because it pays homage to the Gene Wilder iteration while telling its own story.\n\nThe narrative transpires about 15-20 years prior to the events related in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (or, alternately, the 2005 Burton remake, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) in an anonymous European city. That's where a wet-behind-the-ears chocolatier, Willy Wonka (Timothee Chalamet), arrives to make his fortune by opening a shop at the Galeries Gourmet. Unfortunately, as good as Willy's wares are (and they are very good), they can't save him from those who would prey on his naivete, like the innkeeper Mrs. Scrubbit (Olivia Colman), or the leaders of the city's Chocolate Syndicate, Mssrs. Slugworth (Paterson Joseph), Prodnose (Matt Lucas), and Fickelgruber (Matthey Bayton).  \n\nWilly soon finds himself in a perilous position. Unable to pay for his room, he becomes an indentured servant to Mrs. Scrubbit, who forces him to slave away in a launderette. While there, he bonds with the other workers, including the grumpy Abacus Crunch (Jim Carter), and befriends Mrs. Scrubbit's serving girl, Noodle (Calah Lane). He also notices a small orange man following him around; he will later learn that this is Lofty (Hugh Grant), an Oompa-Loompa. Willy is determined not to be defeated by his dire circumstances and hatches an improbable plan by which he will escape from Mrs. Scrubbit's clutches and achieve his dream despite the opposition from the syndicate and their bought-and-paid-for police chief (Keegan-Michael Key).\n\nWonka is sometimes funny, sometimes weird, and sometimes silly. The musical nature of the production requires quite a bit of singing. In addition to several new songs composed by Neil Hannon and Joby Talbot, some of which are catchy, the movie brings back a couple of classics from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory: the Leslie Bricusse/Anthony Newley numbers \"Oompa-Loompa\" (with reworked lyrics) and \"Pure Imagination.\" Sadly, there was no room for \"The Candy Man.\" Generally speaking, the music in Wonka could be considered a high point...with one reservation. As energetic and charismatic as he might be as an actor, Chalamet is a horrible singer. His strident crooning of \"A World of Your Own\" makes the otherwise enjoyable tune into an exercise in endurance.\n\nChalamet's performances echoes that of Gene Wilder without aping him. Whereas Wilder's Wonka was an enigmatic presence, Chalamet's portrayal is uniformly appealing. He is surrounded by an impressive supporting cast that includes Olivia Colman, the gruff Jim Carter (best known as Mr. Carson in Downton Abbey), and Sally Hawkins (as Willy's mom and the inspiration for all his endeavors). Hugh Grant has been cut down to size and colored up (Grant, in typical fashion, indicates he hated playing the part). And Keegan-Michael Key gets to start the film looking somewhat normal before plumping up to resemble Mr. Creosote in one of the movie's best sight gags.\n\nThe set design is fantastical without being overbearing and, late in the proceedings, provide a direct link to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. The humor varies from endearing to subversive. There are instances when one might wonder whether someone from Monty Python snuck in and wrote a few lines. Cash-grab or not, Wonka is a welcome parfait to top off the meatier entrees that the film industry offers at this time of year.\n\n© 2023 James Berardinelli",
